<h1 align='center'><strong>Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eric</strong>
  <h2 align='center'><strong>Software/Cloud Engineer</strong></h2>
  Hey! I'm a rising senior at Hunter College majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I'm currently a SWE intern at TipTop Technologies and a SWE Fellow at Headstarter and CodePath! Throughout the summer I will be exploring new frameworks and libraries while doing my best to advance my cloud knowledge to earn a AWS Solutions Architect Associate certificate. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I am always looking for new opportunities that allow me to contribute to innovative projects and further expand my expertise!
